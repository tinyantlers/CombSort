Comb Sort (Ascending)

This function will sort an array of integer values in ascending order using the Comb Sort algorithm.

Compares elements that are gapSize apart and swaps if they are in the wrong order. After looping through the array, adjust the gapsize (min is 1). 
If gapsize is 1 and no swaps are done in a single pass of the array, the algorithm stops.
The array to sort and the number of elements in the array will be passed as arguments.
